    <h1>Storytime</h1>
    <p>I was given the name Desiree Lopez at birth, but I prefer to go by Dez. I was born in 2001 and raised in the city of Chicago, Illinois. Growing up, I was always surrounded by artistic expressions, a love for creativity, learning and the pursuance of education, which sparked my passion for various artistic mediums.</p>
    <p>I have always found joy in the arts: drawing, painting, music, and media. My journey as an artist was a constant evolution.</p>
    <p>In addition to my artistic pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for learning. I believe that knowledge is a powerful tool that can enhance creativity and broaden one's perspective. Whether it's through formal education or self-directed learning, i believe and educated decision helps make the best decisions.</p>
    <p>As I continue to grow as an creative individual, I am excited to share my journey with others. Through my work, I hope to inspire and connect with people who share a passion for creativity, the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of our everday enviornments and mental health.</p>
